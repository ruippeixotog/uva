# Solutions to UVa Online Judge problems

This repository contains solutions to [UVa Online Judge][1] problems, available at [http://uva.onlinejudge.org][1]. These solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as expected.

## Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing `<problem_id>` with the section and id of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

    $ make <problem_id>

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing `100` with the id of the desired problem:

    $ ./100

Unless stated otherwise, every problem in this repository reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
